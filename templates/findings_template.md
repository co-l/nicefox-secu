## Methodology

This assessment followed a systematic 4-phase approach:

1. **Reconnaissance** - DNS enumeration, subdomain discovery, technology identification, port scanning
2. **Mapping** - Endpoint discovery, API enumeration, parameter identification
3. **Vulnerability Assessment** - Manual and automated testing for common vulnerabilities
4. **Exploitation** - Validation of findings with proof-of-concept demonstrations

Testing was conducted in a {dev/production} environment with {full/limited} testing scope.

## Disclaimer

This security assessment was conducted in a {dev/production} environment with the following scope and limitations:

- Testing was performed on: {target_url}
- Timeframe: {start_date} to {end_date}
- Environment: {dev/production}
- Authorization: {authorized/unauthorized} testing

The findings represent a point-in-time assessment and may not reflect the current security posture if changes have been made since the assessment date.

## Next Steps

1. **Review Findings** - Examine all vulnerabilities and their severity
2. **Generate Fixes** - Run: "Look at FIXES.md and generate fix recommendations for {project}"
3. **Implement Fixes** - Apply code fixes from {project}_pentest_fixes.md
4. **Verify Fixes** - Return to this session and run: "Verify all findings from {project}_pentest_findings.md"
